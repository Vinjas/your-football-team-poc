# Your adidas Team - Proof of concept

"Your adidas team‚Äù is going to be a web application where a user can create their own football team. 

For that, the user needs a way to display the selected players from the different national teams, assign them to the team, and to save the team.

## Functional requirements:

### Rules for football teams:
* Players are selected from national teams.
* Maximum of 4 players from the same team.
* Team size limit to 16 players.

### Each team must have one coach, and at least:
* 4 defenders.
* 4 midfielders.
* 2 attackers.
* 2 goalkeepers.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
